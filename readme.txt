Deliverables:

The evolution JavaScript object contains device data and is streaming in new device reports
as they become available.  For this particular task, you must present the new data as it
becomes available to the end user via a basic table / grid.

For your convenience, we have already setup an event handler in index.html to receive the
data stream.

You must not duplicate data in the grid - new reports for a device should replace / update
You are free to add new frameworks to this project (jQuery has been included by default)
You are free to expand on this deliverable with css or a new feature utilizing the data stream
You are free to remove the <table> grid and replace it with any implementation you see fit

\index.html: Contains a basic web page with a grid and sets up an "evolution" object context
\lib\jquery-1.11.3.min.js: jQuery library
\scripts\datasource.js: Pseudo light weight data feed used for this test


Enjoy!
